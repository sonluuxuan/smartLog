    "#  Models with Linearizable Nonlinear Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "Nonlinearity is often unavoidable, but some frequently occurring nonlinear objective functions are exceptions. We introduce in this section those piecewise linear, minimax, maximin, and absolute value objective functions which though nonlinear at first glance can be modeled with a linear objective function and linear constraints.\n",

    "## Remind: Linear Programming and Polyhedra\n",
