    "Operations planning models decide what work to undertake so that available resources are used efficiently. In **shift scheduling** or **staff planning models** the work is already fixed. We must now plan the resources to accomplish it. In particular, we must decide how many of what types of workers and shifts best cover all work requirements. \n",

    "The Ohio National Bank (ONB) confronted such a problem in staffing its check processing center. Checks received by the bank already have account numbers and other identifying information encoded on them. Machine operators in the check\n",
    "processing center key the dollar amount of the check, which is then imprinted with the other information for computerized processing.\n",

    "Checks arrive through the business day in volumes peaking in the early evening. Our fictitious version will assume the following arrivals (in thousands):\n",

    "![](onb1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Uncollected checks cost the bank money in lost interest. Thus it is essential that all checks be processed in time for collection on the next business day. ONB decided to enforce a requirement that all checks be completed by 22:00 (10 p.m.). Furthermore, the number unprocessed at any hour should not exceed 20 thousand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two types of employees can perform the check processing task. Full-time employees work an 8-hour shift with a 1-hour lunch break in the middle. Part-time employees work only 4 hours per day with no lunch. Both types of shifts can begin\n",
    "at any hour of the day, and full-time employees can be assigned an hour of overtime. Table bellow illustrates the possible shifts.\n",

    "In our analysis we assume that full-time employees receive $\\$$11 per hour in pay and benefits, plus an extra $\\$$ 1 per hour in “night differential” for time after 6 p.m. and 150$\\%$ pay for daily overtime. Part-time employees are paid $\\$$7 per hour, plus $\\$$1 per hour night differential after 6 p.m. Also, to keep overtime under control, we require that no\n",
    "more than half the full-time employees on any shift work overtime and that the total number of scheduled overtime hours not exceed 20 per day.\n",
    "\n",
