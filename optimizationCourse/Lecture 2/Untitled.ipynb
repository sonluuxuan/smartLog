    "\n",
    "One of the simplest forms of linear programs that occurs widely in application might be termed **allocation models**. The main issue is how to divide or allocate a valuable resource among competing needs. The resource may be land, capital, time, fuel, or anything else of limited availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Forest service Allocation\n",
    "\n",
    "The U.S. Forest Service has used just such an allocation model to address the sensitive task of managing 191 million acres of national forestland. The Forest Service must trade off timber, grazing, recreational, environmental, national preservation, and other demands on forestland. \n",
    "\n",
    "Models of a forest begin by dividing land into homogeneous *analysis areas*. Several *prescriptions* or land management policies are then proposed and evaluated for each. The optimization seeks the best possible allocation of land in the analysis areas to particular prescriptions, subject to forest-wide restrictions on land use.\n",

    "Table above provides details of the fictional, 788 thousand acre Wagonho National Forest that we model. Wagonho is assumed to have 7 analysis areas, each subject to 3 different prescriptions.

    "\n",
    "Canadian Forest Products Limited (CFPL) employed such a model to plan their production of plywood. Above figure shows the sequence of stages. Production begins by purchasing logs and peeling them into strips of thin “green” veneer. Green veneer can also be purchased directly. All green veneer is next dried, classified by quality, and in some cases **improved by patching knots and gluing thin strips together**. After the veneer has been cut into sheet sizes, several layers are glued and pressed to produce plywood. A final production step sands completed plywood and trims it to exact size for sale.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of CFPL’s operations research analysis was to determine how to operate production facilities to maximize *contributed margin*: sales income less wood costs. Labor, maintenance, and other plant costs were assumed fixed. The principal constraint, other than limits on availability of wood and the market for various products, was the limited plant capacity to press plywood.\n",
    "\n",
    "To have some numbers to work with, assume that logs are available from two vendors in “good” and “fair” qualities at the rate and price shown below. The table also shows the estimated yield in $\\frac{1}{16}$- and $\\frac{1}{8}$-inch green veneer of grades A, B, and C from peeling a log of the quality indicated.\n",

    "Modeling physically integer quantities with continuous decision variables in this fashion is standard when optimal variable magnitudes are likely to be relatively large. If the LP-optimal number of plywood sheets sold of some type turns out to be, say, 953.2, there is little practical difficulty in rounding off to 953 sheets. After all, the costs, capacities, and other constants in the model are only estimates that contain a certain amount of error.\n",

    "Notice that this concession to tractability would be much more serious when decision variables were limited to, say, 0 and 1. If, for example, 0 means “do not build a facility” and 1 means “build it,” rounding continuous LP solutions could be much more problematic."
